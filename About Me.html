<h1>A bit about me</h1><b>
<p>Recently i brought a course on <a href="www.udemy.com">Udemy</a>, and there i am currently trying to learn how to make web pages like this one.</p>
<p>I have always been an active hardcore gamer trought my whole life and there is where my intresses of pc and programming started from.</p>
<p>I had alot of buddie's trough the years on the net that's always been good with things around computers, for years it made me feel stupid and left alone for no matter how hard i tried to learn it never really did stick with me.</p>
<p>But now i have finaly found the courage to start learning and i will keep on fighting so i can finaly become a better person!</p>
